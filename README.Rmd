# photosearcher

The goal of photosearcher is to provide a repeatable methodology for accessing the Flickr API. More information can be found on the [package website](https://nfox29.github.io/photosearcher/). For more information and examples of the functions check out the [package vignette](https://nfox29.github.io/photosearcher/articles/photosearcher.html).

## Terms of use

This package should be used within accordance of the [Flickr API terms of use](https://www.flickr.com/help/terms/api).

## Installation

You can install the released version of photosearcher from github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("nfox29/photosearcher")
```

## Getting and API key
Before using the package users should sign uo for an API key from the [Flickr development page](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/). The first function of the package you use you will be prompted to enter your API key. The API key will then be saved as a .Rda file and be called to when using any other function

## Package functions
The package currently focuses on the ability to use the Flickr API to search for images and their metadata throught the flickr.photos.search method. The package does however supporst a number of other Flickr API call methods inlcuding the flickr.tags.getRelated and flickr.places.tagsForPlace methods. The Flickr website offers full [API Documentation](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) for all of its call methods.

## Searching for photo
Here is a quick example of how to search for images
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Search for photos of rock climbing betwee 2010 and 2019 in the UK
  foxes <- photo_search(mindate = "2010-01-01",
             maxdate = "2018-01-01",
             text = "rock climbing",
             bbox = "-12.875977,49.210420,2.636719,59.977005",
             has_geo = TRUE)  
```

When the arguement `has_geo` is `TRUE` all images will contain latitude and longitude infomation. These can be plotted using other packages at user preference. Here, the images of UK foxes are plotted using `ggplot2`.
